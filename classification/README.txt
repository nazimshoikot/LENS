The program svm.py creates implements the support vector machine algorithm to create a linear SVC to classify
data into two or more classes. 

Requirements: 
python 3.8.2 or compatible versions
numpy version 1.18.2
pandas version 1.0.3
statsmodels  0.11.1
sklearn 0.22.2.post1

Usage: svm.py
Note: depending on whether the python path variable is added to the local machine, we might need to write python3 before svm.py.
      Usage in that case: python3 svm.py

The program should have the datasets folder given in the assignment in the same directory as the svm.py. It will first
read relevant data from the breastcancer dataset files, run the model on the data, and report the accuracy and precision of
the predictions. It will then read relevant data from the iris dataset files, run the model on the data, and report the accuracy 
of the predictions.

Implementation details and the discussion of the results are in the pdf report.
