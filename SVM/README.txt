The program svm.py creates and implements the support vector machine algorithm to create a linear SVC to classify
data into two or more classes. 

Requirements: 
python 3.8.2 or compatible versions
numpy version 1.18.2
pandas version 1.0.3
statsmodels  0.11.1
sklearn 0.22.2.post1

Usage: svm.py

The program will first read relevant data from the breastcancer dataset files, run the model on the data, and report the accuracy and precision of
the predictions. It will then read relevant data from the iris dataset files, run the model on the data, and report the accuracy of the predictions.
